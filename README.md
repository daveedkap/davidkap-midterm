# 3 PAGE WRITE UP: Predicting Amazon Movie Review Star Ratings

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to predict the star ratings of Amazon Movie Reviews using the available features. This document outlines the final algorithm implemented, the feature engineering techniques employed, the rationale behind model selection, and the special methods used to enhance performance. The focus is on the analytical approach and insights gained rather than on code specifics.

## Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The project began by loading the training and testing datasets containing user reviews and associated metadata. An initial exploration of the training data provided insights into the distribution of the target variable, 'Score'. Visualizing the frequency of each star rating revealed class imbalances, with certain ratings being more prevalent than others.

## Feature Engineering
To improve the predictive power of the model, new features were engineered from the existing data.

### Helpfulness Ratio
A new feature, 'Helpfulness', was created to represent the ratio of the number of users who found the review helpful ('HelpfulnessNumerator') to the total number of users who rated the review ('HelpfulnessDenominator'): Helpfulness = HelpfulnessNumerator / HelpfulnessDenominator

*Assumption*: Reviews deemed more helpful by users may correlate with certain star ratings, as they might reflect more thoughtful or detailed feedback.

### Review Length
Another feature, 'ReviewLength', was introduced to measure the length of each review text: ReviewLength = Number of characters in the review text

*Assumption*: Longer reviews might express stronger sentiments or provide more nuanced opinions, potentially influencing the star rating.

## Data Preprocessing
The datasets were preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure consistency:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the 'Helpfulness' feature (due to division by zero when the denominator is zero) were filled with zero.
- **Data Consistency**: Ensured that all features were correctly aligned between the training and testing datasets.

*Thought Process*: Proper data preprocessing is crucial to prevent errors during model training and to improve the model's generalization capabilities.

## Model Creation

### Model Choice: Random Forest Classifier
A `RandomForestClassifier` from the `sklearn.ensemble` module was chosen for this task due to its robustness and ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

#### Advantages of Random Forest:
- Handles high-dimensional data well.
- Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging.
- Provides feature importance metrics.

### Data Standardization
A `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` was used to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

*Rationale*: Standardization ensures that all features contribute equally to the model training, preventing features with larger scales from dominating.

### Pipeline Implementation
A pipeline was created using `sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline` to streamline the preprocessing and modeling steps.

### Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV
Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using `sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV` to find the optimal model parameters:

#### Parameters Tuned:
- Number of estimators (`n_estimators`)
- Maximum depth of the tree (`max_depth`)
- Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (`min_samples_split`)

#### Process:
- Defined a parameter grid with different values for each hyperparameter.
- Performed cross-validation to evaluate each combination.
- Selected the model with the best performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation

### Accuracy Score
The model's accuracy was evaluated on the validation set:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions over the total predictions made.
- **Result**: The model achieved a certain level of accuracy (specific value depends on the dataset), indicating its effectiveness in predicting star ratings.

### Confusion Matrix
A confusion matrix was generated to visualize the model's performance across different classes:

- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted ratings.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted ratings where the predicted rating is higher than the true rating.
- **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted ratings where the predicted rating is lower than the true rating.

**Observation**: The confusion matrix revealed that the model performed better on certain star ratings, particularly those with more training examples, and struggled with less frequent ratings.

## Patterns Noticed and Utilized

### Helpfulness Ratio Impact
- **Pattern**: Reviews with a high helpfulness ratio often correlated with extreme star ratings (very positive or very negative).
- **Utilization**: Including the 'Helpfulness' feature allowed the model to capture this pattern, improving prediction accuracy for these ratings.

### Review Length Significance
- **Pattern**: Longer reviews tended to express more detailed opinions, which could be associated with higher or lower ratings.
- **Utilization**: The 'ReviewLength' feature enabled the model to consider the verbosity of the review as an indicator of the user's sentiment intensity.

### Temporal Trends
- **Pattern**: The time when a review was posted might influence its rating due to changes in consumer sentiment or product popularity over time.
- **Utilization**: Including the 'Time' feature allowed the model to account for temporal effects on review scores.

*Thought Process*: By identifying and leveraging these patterns, the model could better understand the underlying factors influencing star ratings.

## Assumptions Made

- **Helpfulness Ratio Validity**: Assumed that the helpfulness ratio is meaningful even when the denominator is zero; addressed potential division by zero errors by filling NaN values with zero.
- **Review Text Availability**: Assumed that all reviews have associated text; in cases where text was missing, treated the review length as zero.
- **Feature Independence**: Assumed that selected features contribute independently to the prediction, justifying their inclusion without multicollinearity checks.

## Conclusion
By combining thoughtful feature engineering, systematic hyperparameter tuning, and careful model evaluation, the final algorithm effectively predicts the star ratings of Amazon Movie Reviews. The special methods employed, such as creating meaningful new features and leveraging pipeline and grid search capabilities, contributed to improved performance and a deeper understanding of the data.

### Future Work:
Exploring text-based features using techniques like TF-IDF Vectorization (from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`) could capture the sentiment expressed in the reviews more directly, potentially enhancing the model's predictive power.

A few of these methods were briefly covered in labs or class, but I will reiterate all of them anyways.

### RandomForestClassifier:
The `RandomForestClassifier` is part of the `sklearn.ensemble` module, which is designed for classification problems using an ensemble learning approach, involving constructing a multitude of decision trees during training. This method was introduced by Breiman (2001) and is widely used for its ability to handle both classification and regression tasks while reducing overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

# Explanation of How ChatGPT Contributed to Crafting the Algorithm

To develop the machine learning algorithm in the code, I used ChatGPT to assist in integrating several key methods from the `sklearn` library, specifically focusing on improving both the preprocessing and model training phases. Here's a breakdown of how these methods were integrated:

### Preprocessing the Data:
Initially, the algorithm required scaling of the features, especially numerical ones such as `Helpfulness` and `ReviewLength`. I used the `StandardScaler` within a pipeline to ensure that the scaling would be automatically applied during model training. This was crucial to avoid skewed model performance caused by differing scales of the features.

### Text Feature Extraction:
Given that the dataset contains text (e.g., the review text), I considered using the `TfidfVectorizer` for extracting relevant features from text data. Although it was not integrated in the final pipeline (due to focus on numerical features in the provided code), I used the method offline during exploratory analysis to investigate how text features might influence model performance. This step would allow the addition of textual features in the future to improve predictions.

### Building a Pipeline with `make_pipeline`:
To streamline the process of preprocessing and model training, I used the `make_pipeline` function. It allowed me to combine the scaling step (`StandardScaler`) and the model (`RandomForestClassifier`) into a single pipeline. This simplifies the code and ensures that preprocessing steps are not forgotten during the training or prediction phases. The use of pipelines ensures reproducibility and ease of cross-validation, as the entire pipeline is treated as a single object.

### Model Training with `RandomForestClassifier`:
The `RandomForestClassifier` was chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle a variety of feature types. It performs well in many classification tasks because it reduces overfitting and provides good out-of-the-box accuracy. By using the `RandomForestClassifier`, I ensured that the model would be able to handle the mix of numerical features extracted from the dataset, such as the review helpfulness and review length.

### Hyperparameter Tuning with `GridSearchCV`:
To further optimize the model, I implemented `GridSearchCV`, allowing an automated search for the best combination of hyperparameters for the `RandomForestClassifier`. By specifying ranges for the number of trees (`n_estimators`), the maximum depth of trees (`max_depth`), and the minimum samples required to split a node (`min_samples_split`), I was able to explore various model configurations. ChatGPT assisted in determining the key hyperparameters to tune and in setting up the `GridSearchCV` function efficiently.

# Offline Evaluation of the Methods

In offline evaluations, I assessed the performance of the algorithm on the provided training and test sets. Here’s an outline of the evaluation steps:

### Splitting the Data:
I used `train_test_split` to create a testing set from the original training data. This allowed me to evaluate the model’s performance before using the test dataset for predictions.

### Accuracy Evaluation:
After training the model, I evaluated its performance on the test set using `accuracy_score`. The accuracy metric provided a quick measure of how well the model performed, although further evaluation could include precision, recall, and F1 scores for a more detailed assessment.

### Confusion Matrix:
To visually assess the model's performance across different classes, I generated a confusion matrix using `confusion_matrix` and visualized it with `seaborn`. This helped in understanding where the model made correct predictions versus where it misclassified instances, thus providing insights into any class imbalance or specific weaknesses.

### Creating the Submission File:
Once the model was optimized, I used it to predict the `Score` values for the test set and generated the submission file. This demonstrates that the algorithm was successfully applied to real-world data, ready for external evaluation.
